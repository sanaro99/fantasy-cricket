# Selections & Scoring

In the Fantasy Cricket app, users select up to **4 players** from each team (8 total) for each match.

## Selection Logic

- UI components responsible:
  - `components/Matches.jsx`:
    - `TodayMatchCard` component
    - `SquadSelector` sub-component
    - Functions: `handleSelectPlayer`, `handleSubmitSelection`

## Scoring Criteria

- **Batting** (`pages/api/run-leaderboard.js`):
  - 30 points for scoring 30+ runs
  - 60 points for scoring 50+ runs
  - 150 points for scoring 100+ runs
  - Only the highest milestone is awarded per player (not cumulative)
  - Implemented in helper: `playerPoints`

- **Bowling** (`pages/api/run-leaderboard.js`):
  - 30 points per wicket taken
  - Aggregated via `mapWickets` logic

- **Sixes**:
  - 5 points for each six hit by a player (using `six_x` from batting array)
