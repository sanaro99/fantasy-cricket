# Selections & Scoring

In the Fantasy Cricket app, users select up to **4 players** from each team (8 total) for each match.

## Selection Logic

- UI components responsible:
  - `components/Matches.jsx`:
    - `TodayMatchCard` component
    - `SquadSelector` sub-component
    - Functions: `handleSelectPlayer`, `handleSubmitSelection`

## Scoring Criteria

- **Batting** (`pages/api/run-leaderboard.js`):
  - 50 points for a half-century (50+ runs)
  - 150 points for a century (100+ runs)
  - Implemented in helper: `playerPoints`

- **Bowling** (`pages/api/run-leaderboard.js`):
  - 30 points per wicket taken
  - Aggregated via `mapWickets` logic

Refer to the above files for full implementation details.
